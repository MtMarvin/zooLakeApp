                <h3>GORILLA</h3>

                <p>
                    Gorillas are ground-dwelling, mostly herbivorous apes native to the forests of Central Africa.
                    The genus <em>Gorilla</em> is divided into two species: eastern gorillas and western gorillas, 
                    with either four or five subspecies depending on classification.
                    They are the largest living primates by physical size.
                    Gorillas share 95â€“99% of their DNA with humans, making them our second-closest living relatives after chimpanzees and bonobos.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Gorillas inhabit tropical and subtropical forests across a range of elevations.
                    Mountain gorillas live in the high-altitude cloud forests of the Virunga Volcanoes,
                    from 2,200 to 4,300 meters (7,200 to 14,100 ft).
                    Lowland gorillas are found in dense forests and swamps, sometimes near sea level.
                    Western lowland gorillas are native to Central West Africa, while eastern lowland gorillas are found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo near Rwanda.

                <h4>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</h4>
                <p>
                    You can find the gorillas at enclosure GO12.
