                <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>

                <p>
                    The giraffe (<em>Giraffa camelopardalis</em>) is an African even-toed ungulate mammal, 
                    and is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant. 
                    Its species name refers to its camel-like shape and leopard-like coloring.
                    Giraffes are easily recognized by their extremely long necks and legs, horn-like ossicones, 
                    and distinctive coat patterns. Their closest living relative is the okapi.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Giraffes are found from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south, and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east. 
                    They typically inhabit savannahs, grasslands, and open woodlands, where their primary food source is acacia leaves â€” which 
                    they can reach at heights most other herbivores cannot.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Giraffes are preyed upon by lions, while calves may fall prey to leopards, hyenas, and wild dogs. 
                    Although not strongly social, giraffes form loose groups when moving in similar directions. 
                    Male giraffes compete for dominance using their necks in a behavior called "necking". 
                    Dominant males gain access to females, who raise the young alone.

                <h4>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</h4>
                <p>
                    You will find the giraffes at enclosure G15, just beyond the research centre.
