                <h3>PANDAS</h3>
                <p>
                    The giant panda (<em>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</em>), also known as the panda bear or simply panda, is a bear native to south-central China. It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive black patches around its eyes, over its ears, and across its round body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the unrelated red panda. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda's diet is over 99% bamboo. In the wild, they may occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat such as birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, their diet may also include honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas, along with specially prepared food.

                    The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan province, but also in neighboring provinces Shaanxi and Gansu. Due to farming, deforestation, and other development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived.

                    The giant panda is a conservation-reliant endangered species.
