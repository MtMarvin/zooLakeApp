                <h3>ELEPHANT</h3>
                
                <p>
                    Elephants are large mammals of the family <em>Elephantidae</em> and the order <em>Proboscidea</em>.
                    Two species are traditionally recognized: the African elephant (<em>Loxodonta africana</em>) and the Asian elephant (<em>Elephas maximus</em>). 
                    Elephants are found across sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. 
                    Male African elephants are the largest living land animals, reaching up to 4 meters (13 ft) in height and weighing up to 7,000 kg (15,000 lb).

                <p>
                    Elephants have several distinctive features. Most notably, their long trunks are used for breathing, lifting water, and grasping objects. 
                    Their tusks—actually elongated incisors—can be used as tools and weapons. 
                    Their large ears help regulate body temperature, and their strong, pillar-like legs support their massive weight. 
                    African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, while Asian elephants have smaller ears and more convex or level backs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Elephants are herbivores and inhabit diverse environments such as savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes. 
                    They are typically found near water sources.
