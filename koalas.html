                <h3>KOALA</h3>

                <p>
                    The koala (<em>Phascolarctos cinereus</em>) is an arboreal, herbivorous marsupial native to Australia.
                    It is the only surviving member of the family Phascolarctidae. Koalas are found in the eastern and southern coastal regions of mainland Australia—
                    including Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Koalas are easily recognized by their stocky, tailless bodies, large round ears, and spoon-shaped noses.
                    They typically measure 60–85 cm (24–33 in) in length and weigh between 4–15 kg (9–33 lb).
                    Their fur ranges from silver-grey to chocolate-brown, with northern populations generally being smaller and lighter.

                <p>
                    These marsupials live in open eucalypt woodlands and feed almost exclusively on eucalyptus leaves.
                    Due to their low-calorie diet, koalas are mostly sedentary, sleeping up to 20 hours a day.
                    They are generally solitary, with bonding limited to mothers and their joeys.

                <p>
                    Male koalas communicate through deep bellows and mark their territory with chest scent glands.
                    Joeys are born underdeveloped and continue to grow inside their mother’s pouch for 6 to 7 months.
                    Despite having few natural predators, koalas face threats from diseases (like chlamydia), habitat loss, bushfires, and climate-related droughts.
