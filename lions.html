                <h3>LIONS</h3>

                <p>
                    The lion (<em>Panthera leo</em>) is one of the five big cats in the genus Panthera and a member of the family Felidae.
                    The term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies found in Africa. With some males exceeding 250 kg (550 lb),
                    it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Lions are considered a vulnerable species, having experienced a population decline of 30 to 50% per two decades during the second half of the twentieth century.
                    Lion populations are largely confined to designated reserves and national parks.
                    The main causes for their decline include habitat loss and conflicts with humans, with the West African lion population particularly endangered.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Wild lions currently live in sub-Saharan Africa and in Asia, where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park in India.
                    Historically, lions were widespread across Africa, Eurasia, and the Americas until about 10,000 years ago.
